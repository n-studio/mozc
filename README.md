What's Mozc?
------------
For historical reasons, the project name *Mozc* has two different meanings:

1. Internal code name of Google Japanese Input that is still commonly used
   inside Google.
2. Project name to release a subset of Google Japanese Input in the form of
   source code under OSS license without any warranty nor user support.

In this repository, *Mozc* means the second definition unless otherwise noted.
